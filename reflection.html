    <h1>Final Class Reflection</h1>
    <p>An engaging subtitle that introduces the topic</p>
</header>

<article>
    <p>Throughout the semester, our class explored the intersections of digital humanities, historical analysis, and ethical representation, with particular attention to how we interact with and interpret historical data from marginalized voices. These themes were especially prevalent in our two main projects: the Printing in Prisons multimedia essay and our collaborative Education Commons project, Echoes of Festivities. While each project had unique goals, both projects underscored the value of data-driven storytelling in humanizing historical figures and communities.</p>
    <p> My Printing in Prisons multimedia essay focused on William Marvel, a repeated offender who, through his writing and advocacy, emerged as a proponent of reform within Eastern State. His story illuminated the possibilities and limitations of incarceration reform in the early 20th century. I sought to highlight his vision for parole as a means of cultivating responsibility and dignity. Marvel’s reflections in The Umpire emphasized that parole programs should address the profound question of “after prison – what?” His call for supervised freedom paired with steady employment reflected a progressive view, especially for his time.</p>
    <p>What I found particularly rewarding about this project was the opportunity to engage with archival material in a way that demanded ethical care. I discovered throughout the project that his descendants had previously conducted archival research, and thus may one day encounter my work, so I approached my writing with empathy and deliberacy. The challenge of telling Marvel’s story without reducing him to the sum of his criminal records also resonated with ideas from The Ethics of Digital Data on Convict Lives. The Digital Panopticon exposes important patterns in historical data, but it also is subject to ethical concerns, such as reproducing the biases of the archive or illuminating sensitive details about individuals’ lives​. In my essay, I kept these concerns in mind. I avoided framing Marvel solely as a recidivist; instead, I portrayed him as an advocate for change and a figure perhaps emblematic of the struggles and potential for rehabilitation within a flawed system.</p>
    <p>My EC project, Echoes of Festivities, took a different but complementary approach, combining data visualization with fabrication to explore holiday mentions in The Umpire. Our 12-tiered tree structure visualized how inmates celebrated or acknowledged holidays in 1916. This project, at its heart, sought to humanize the lives of Eastern State’s incarcerated population by placing their experiences within the cultural context of the outside world. The stickers and tree layers provided a tangible, creative interface for engaging with historical data, connecting modern viewers to the lives of those in the archives. What stood out most was how the EC project visualized data while addressing ethical concerns about representation. As Hepworth and Church argue in “Racism in the Machine,” data visualizations are inherently rhetorical and shaped by the design decisions we make​. In our project, these decisions included choosing stickers to resemble each holiday. These served as an approachable format that emphasized collective memory rather than individual difficulties. This choice aligns with ethical visualization practices, as it aimed to present the data in a way that was accessible and empathetic.</p>
    <blockquote>"Both projects underscored the value of data-driven storytelling in humanizing historical figures and communities."</blockquote>
    <p>Looking back, I see how both projects embodied central themes from our readings and discussions. One more recurring idea in digital humanities is the tension between preservation and interpretation. Material/Digital explores this tension, noting that digital surrogates can both illuminate and obscure aspects of physical texts​. This insight applied directly to the multimedia essay, where digitized prison records allowed me to access Marvel’s contributions to The Umpire, but I needed to ensure I wrote a careful interpretation to avoid stripping his writings of their physical context as part of The Umpire. </p>
    <p>Similarly, our class’s emphasis on the ethics of cleaning data proved relevant to the EC project. Rawson and Muñoz’s critique of “data cleaning” as a reductive process highlights the need to maintain the complexity of messy datasets​. In our case, normalizing holiday mentions for our analysis risked erasing nuances in how these holidays were documented. A more extended timeline or additional data points could have enriched our visualization such that our work acknowledged these complexities more fully.</p>
    <p>My expectations of digital humanities at the semester’s start centered on technology-driven ways to analyze historical and literary texts. I now see it as a deeply interdisciplinary field that demands both technical proficiency and ethical reflection, and involves many questions about how to approach, analyze, and preserve archival material. The projects affirmed my interest in using creative tools to engage with historical narratives, like laser cutting or 3D printing. I enjoy adding a qualitative dimension to quantitative data, and this class introduced me to new ways to both contemplate and make those choices. The class also challenged me to think critically about the implications of my design choices and interpretations.</p>
    <p>Reflecting on my contributions, I believe I succeeded in crafting narratives that were both informative and empathetic. If I could revise either project, I would deepen my engagement with the data by broadening the scope of each project and seeking out additional sources to incorporate additional perspectives. For example, in the EC project, we could have explored holidays across the years documented in The Umpire, or perhaps compared the data we analyzed from The Umpire with that from The Eastern Echo to compare changes across the decades.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, both projects underscored the power of analysis through the lens of digital humanities to highlight marginalized voices and represent previously ambiguous patterns in teh data. The material I learned this semester served as an important reminder that behind every dataset lies a story, and our role as scholars is to tell each story with integrity and thoughtfulness.
